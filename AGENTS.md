# AGENTS.md — google-tui

Multi-pane terminal TUI for Brad's Google Workspace (Gmail, Calendar, Tasks,
Drive) plus a "Hermes Ask" pane. Built with [Textual](https://textual.textualize.io/).
Python 3.13, package layout under `/home/bradb/google-tui/google_tui/`.

This file is the single source of truth for a future session to continue work
WITHOUT prior chat context. Read it top-to-bottom before touching code.

## 1. What the app does

Eight full-width **tabs** live in the blue bar (this IS the styled `Tabs`
bar of the outer `TabbedContent#main-tabs`, not a separate status widget):
**Mail**, **Calendar**, **Drive**, **Browser**, **News**, **Navigation**,
**Settings**, **Contacts**. The Mail tab holds four **panes**: Email,
Events, Tasks, Hermes. Tabs and panes are deliberately different concepts
with different key prefixes (`Ctrl+#` for tabs, `Alt+#` for panes) — see §2.

App startup is **cache-first**: whatever was cached from the last run (see
§1a) is applied to the UI instantly, then a background thread reconnects to
Google and refreshes it. `Header.sub_title` shows `Connecting…` →
`Synced HH:MM` or `Offline (cached HH:MM)`. `LoadingModal` only appears on a
genuine first run with an empty cache — the initial live fetch (mail +
calendar + drive) commonly takes ~20s (see the NOTE on `list_threads` below),
so on every run after the first, the app is interactive immediately instead
of blocking on that.

## 1a. Local cache, offline mode, encryption-at-rest

- **`google_tui/cache.py`** — `Cache`, a SQLite (`cache_items(category, key,
  payload, updated_at)`) key/value store, one row per cached object,
  optionally Fernet-encrypted per row. Categories: `thread_summary`,
  `thread_body` (unused so far — bodies aren't cached, only summaries),
  `event`, `task`, `tasklist`, `cal_month` (key `YYYY-MM`), `cal_week` (key
  = the Monday's ISO date), `drive_listing` (key = folder id, only `root`
  is ever fetched today), `drive_file_meta`, `drive_file_text` (both keyed
  by file id, populated lazily — only after a live Drive preview actually
  succeeds for that file, never pre-fetched for a whole folder),
  `gemini_cert` (key `f"{host}:{port}"`, Browser tab's Gemini TOFU pinning,
  P1 M2), `feed_entry` (key = the entry's stable id — `entry.id` or
  `entry.link` — News tab, P1 M3).
  **Design intent**: small "browse" rows (summaries/listings) are cheap to
  bulk-decrypt on every list population; large "content" rows (Drive text)
  are decrypted one at a time, only when opened. This is what makes
  encryption not cost a "potato laptop" anything proportional to total
  cache size — see the module docstring.
- **`google_tui/settings.py`** — `Settings` dataclass persisted as
  **plaintext** JSON at `platformdirs.user_config_dir("google-tui")/
  settings.json` (`encrypt_at_rest`, `key_method`, `kdf_salt`, `canary`).
  Must stay plaintext: the app needs to know the key method before it can
  derive or verify any key.
- **Key methods** (`Settings.key_method`): `"keyfile"` — a random Fernet key
  at `.../cache.key`, chmod 0600, no prompt ever. `"passphrase"` — a key
  derived via scrypt from a passphrase typed at launch (`UnlockModal`,
  mode="unlock"); verified against a stored `canary` (a Fernet-encrypted
  known string) so a wrong passphrase is caught before it's trusted, not
  after decrypting garbage. The passphrase itself is NEVER written to disk;
  only `kdf_salt` and `canary` are.
- **Turning encryption on/off, or switching key method, always
  `Cache.clear_all()`s immediately** (no re-encryption/migration code) and
  tells the user to restart. This is a deliberate simplification — see
  ROADMAP.
- **Offline behavior is intentionally narrow**: `self._online: bool` is set
  by `_apply_live_refresh` after each connect attempt. Reply/Reply All/
  Forward/toggle-task check `self._require_online()` first and just
  `notify(..., severity="warning")` instead of attempting the call — there
  is NO queue-for-later/sync-when-reconnected mechanism. Drive preview reads
  from cache instead of `gauth` when offline. This is "browse cached data
  read-only while offline," not a sync engine.

Mail-tab panes:
- **Email** (left, full height): threaded Gmail list, lightbar. `Enter`
  opens the full thread (`ThreadModal`); `Space` expands/collapses the
  highlighted row IN PLACE (mutates just that one `ListItem`'s `Label` text
  — see `_toggle_thread_expand` — to append the thread's snippet, and a
  `(N messages)` note if `count > 1`; does NOT open `ThreadModal`, and does
  NOT `ListView.clear()`/repopulate). `l` focuses `Select#email-label-select`
  and opens its dropdown (`action_focus_label_select`). `r`/`a`/`f` reply /
  reply-all / forward (compose modal). Unread threads prefixed with a
  bullet `•`. `self._threads_cache: dict[str, dict]` (threadId -> thread
  dict) backs the expand lookup, populated everywhere `_apply_email_list`/
  `_apply_mail_data_async` populate the list; `self._expanded_thread_ids:
  set[str]` tracks which threads are currently expanded and naturally
  resets whenever the list is torn down and repopulated (no persistence).
- **Events** (right top, renamed from "Calendar" to avoid clashing with the
  Calendar tab): next ~3 weeks of events, lightbar, `Enter`/`Space` → detail.
- **Tasks** (right middle): all Google Task lists combined, lightbar.
  `Space` toggles complete (live), `Enter` shows details/subtasks.
- **Hermes Ask** (right bottom): type question, `Enter`. General questions
  answered by the Nous LLM (`tencent/hy3:free`) with live Google context
  injected; action-style questions delegate to the full Hermes agent.

Other tabs:
- **Calendar tab**: nested `TabbedContent#cal-tabs` (Month/Week), unrelated
  to the outer tab bar. Month = `DataTable#cal-grid` with multi-line rows
  (day number + up to 2 events + `+N more`); `Enter`/click on a day opens
  `DayEventsModal`. Week = `DataTable#cal-week-grid`, 24 hour rows x 7 day
  columns, an event's summary is written into every hour row it spans (a
  text-cell approximation of a Gantt block — DataTable is a grid of cells,
  not a pixel canvas). `[`/`]` page the month, or the week when the Week
  sub-tab is active. `/` focuses `Input#cal-search` (in `#cal-search-bar`,
  above `#cal-tabs`, visible in both sub-tabs) and is a **jump-to-next-match**,
  NOT a filter like the ListView-backed panes: Enter runs `_cal_find`, which
  moves the active grid's `DataTable` cursor to the next day (Month) or
  hour-cell (Week) whose event(s) match `_fuzzy_score` (summary+description),
  relative to the current cursor and wrapping — repeat-Enter of the same query
  advances (`_cal_search_matches`/`_cal_search_pos`, the same find-next idiom
  as `ThreadModal._find`). Searches only what the active view has loaded
  (`_cal_by_day`/`_cal_week_cells`), never a new fetch. See CHANGELOG
  `[2026-07-15]`.
- **Drive tab**: `ListView#drive-list` (left) + live preview pane (right).
  Preview updates on `ListView.Highlighted` (cursor movement), not just
  `Selected` — metadata (who/what/where/when) always shown; text preview
  only for `_is_previewable()` mime types. "Up" always reloads root, not the
  true parent folder (pre-existing simplification, not fixed by the tab
  redesign — see §7). Offline: reads `drive_file_meta`/`drive_file_text`
  from cache instead of `gauth`; shows "not available offline" for a file
  that was never viewed while online.
  - `gauth.get_file_metadata(svc, file_id)` — added for the preview's
    who/what/where/when: `fields="id,name,mimeType,size,owners,
    modifiedTime,createdTime,parents,webViewLink"`.
- **Browser tab** (`Ctrl+4`, P1 M2): address bar (`Input#browser-url`) + a
  mode badge (`Static#browser-mode`: WEB/GOPHER/GEMINI/SEARCH) + a
  `render.DocumentView` (`#browser-doc`) rendering whatever came back. A
  "new tab page" row of starter-destination buttons (`Horizontal
  #browser-bookmarks`, between `#browser-bar` and `#browser-doc`) — module-
  level `_BROWSER_BOOKMARKS` list (Google/Wikipedia/Gopherpedia/Gemini
  Protocol, one per non-search protocol) — is visible until the first
  successful page load or search of the session, then gets `.hidden`'d
  permanently (`self._browser_started: bool`, flipped inside
  `_browser_apply_document`) and never reappears; clicking a bookmark
  (`on_button_pressed`'s `browser-bookmark-<i>` branch) navigates exactly
  like typed address-bar input. Address-bar submission is classified by
  `_classify_address()` (omnibox heuristic: explicit
  `http(s)://`/`gopher://`/`gemini://` wins; a single dotted-word-with-no-
  space gets `https://` prepended; everything else, including any text
  containing a space, is a web search via `fetchers.run_search` — see
  below). Fetching lives in `google_tui/fetchers.py`
  (`fetch_http`/`fetch_gopher`/`fetch_gemini`/`run_search` and its three
  backends), never in `render.py` (which stays I/O-free) or `main.py`
  directly — every `fetch_*`/search call is blocking and run via
  `self.run_worker(fn, thread=True, exclusive=True, group="browser-fetch")`,
  same fetch/apply split as the rest of the app. History is an in-memory
  `list[BrowserHistoryEntry]` (already-fetched `Document`s, not just URLs —
  Back/Forward never re-fetches) — session-lifetime only, no SQLite cache
  category for page content. `Alt+Left/Right` are back/forward (not `[`/`]`)
  when the Browser tab is active; `Alt+H` (P2, 2026-07-15) jumps to
  `Settings.browser_home_url` (default `https://www.google.com`, editable in
  Settings → General) the same way clicking a bookmark button does; `Tab`/
  `Shift+Tab` toggle focus between the address bar and the page. `Page Up/
  Down/Home/End` inside `DocumentView` scroll instantly — see `render.py`'s
  `action_page_up`/`action_page_down`/`action_scroll_home`/`action_scroll_end`
  overrides (2026-07-15): Textual's stock versions of these actions animate
  the scroll (`speed=50` lines/sec for Page Up/Down, a flat `duration=1.0`
  for Home/End), which read as multi-second hangs on a document reader;
  `_render_blocks` itself was never the bottleneck (profiled at ~40ms even
  for 5000 blocks, and done once at `.document =` time, not per scroll — see
  CHANGELOG). Gemini's TOFU cert pinning uses a new `Cache`
  category (`"gemini_cert"`, key `f"{host}:{port}"`) via
  `fetchers.GeminiTofuStore`; Gemini status 1x (input) and cross-host 3x
  (redirect) responses raise
  `fetchers.GeminiInputRequired`/`GeminiRedirectConfirm`, each handled by a
  small modal (`GeminiInputModal`/`ConfirmModal`) that resumes navigation
  through `_browser_navigate` on confirm. Never gated by
  `self._require_online()` — that flag tracks Google reachability
  specifically, unrelated to arbitrary web/gopher/gemini/search fetches.
  Search mode: `fetchers.run_search(query, settings)` dispatches to
  `search_google_cse`/`search_duckduckgo`/`search_searxng` per
  `Settings.search_provider` (default `"google"`), with DuckDuckGo (no API
  key needed) as the fallback for every path — see CHANGELOG `[2026-07-14]`
  for the exact fallback chain. This replaced the old `ask.google_search`
  shell-out to `hermes web search`, which stopped working once that
  subcommand disappeared from the installed `hermes` CLI (see the removed
  P3 ROADMAP item, now in CHANGELOG). Every search result becomes a real
  numbered `render.Link` via `fetchers._search_results_to_document`, so
  Search results get the same digit + `Enter` navigation as Gopher/Gemini
  menus and HTTP page links.
- **News tab** (`Ctrl+5`, P1 M3): `ListView#news-list`, the same lightbar
  pattern as the Email pane, showing entries from EVERY subscribed feed
  combined (like the Tasks pane combines all Google tasklists), sorted
  newest-first by `published` (an ISO-8601 UTC string `fetchers.fetch_feed`
  derives from feedparser's normalized `*_parsed` struct_time, so sorting is
  a plain string comparison — raw feed date formats vary too much to sort
  directly). Each row: `MM/DD  [Feed Title] Entry Title` (both truncated,
  same style as `_append_email_items`). Fetching is `fetchers.fetch_feed(url)`
  (new; uses `feedparser`, HTTP done via `requests` like `fetch_http` for
  consistent timeout/User-Agent handling, not feedparser's own URL-fetch
  path) — returns plain dicts (`id`, `title`, `link`, `summary`, `published`,
  `feed_title`, `feed_url`), matching `gauth.py`'s list-of-dict convention.
  `Enter`/`Space` opens `NewsEntryModal` (modeled on `EventModal`/`TaskModal`
  — pushed WITHOUT a callback, since unlike `ThreadModal` there's no
  follow-up action to relay back), which parses the entry body via M1's
  `render.parse_feed_entry(title, summary, base_url=link)` into a `Document`
  shown in a `render.DocumentView`. Item ids use `_mk_id("n", entry["id"])`;
  since a feed entry's real id is very often a URL, `_mk_id`'s sanitizing is
  lossy in that direction, so `self._news_by_cid: dict[str, dict]` (cid ->
  entry dict, rebuilt on every apply) is the lookup, not a `cid[2:]` slice
  like the Email/Tasks/Events lists use. Cached under a new `Cache` category
  `"feed_entry"` (keyed by entry id), fetched/applied via
  `_fetch_news_data`/`_write_news_cache`/`_apply_news_data` exactly like the
  other data sources (see §8, §2's `ListView.clear()` NOTE — `_apply_news_data`
  uses the same generation-counter + awaited-`run_worker` pattern as
  `_apply_mail_data`/`_apply_drive_files`, since it can be applied more than
  once per session: cache load, live refresh, AND every add/remove in
  Settings). Each subscribed feed is fetched in its own try/except inside
  `_fetch_news_data` so one broken feed URL doesn't take down the others —
  but, deliberately, a feed failure does NOT flip `self._online`/the
  Synced-Offline header the way a Gmail/Calendar/Drive failure does: that
  flag is specifically about Google reachability (§1a), and feed URLs are
  unrelated third-party sites. Row/meta `Label`/`Static` widgets built from
  feed content are constructed with `markup=False` — feed titles are
  untrusted external text and Textual's `Content.from_markup()` (what
  `Label`/`Static` route through by default) silently swallows anything
  that looks like `[a tag]`, including a plain `"[Feed Title]"` with no
  malicious intent; `rich.markup.escape()` does NOT reliably fix this
  (confirmed empirically — its tag-detection regex doesn't even touch a
  bracketed phrase containing a space, and `Content.from_markup()` still ate
  it), so `markup=False` is the correct fix, not escaping.
- **Navigation tab** (`Ctrl+6`, P1 M6): driving directions via the Google
  Routes API (`POST https://routes.googleapis.com/directions/v2:
  computeRoutes`). Two `Input`s (`#nav-origin`/`#nav-destination`, free-text
  addresses — the Routes API geocodes these itself, no Places API/exact-
  coordinates needed) + a `Button#nav-go`; `Enter` in either input or the
  button both call `_nav_go`. Fetching is `fetchers.compute_route(origin,
  destination, api_key)`, unlike this app's other fetchers (query-param
  `requests.get`) because the Routes API needs a JSON POST body plus
  mandatory `X-Goog-Api-Key`/`X-Goog-FieldMask` headers; returns a plain
  `fetchers.RouteResult` dataclass (`distance_text`/`duration_text`/
  `steps: list[RouteStep]`), NOT a `render.Document` — there's nothing to
  hyperlink-navigate in a turn-by-turn step list. Units/language/travel
  mode are hardcoded (`IMPERIAL`/`en-US`/`DRIVE`) rather than Settings
  fields — a v1 simplification. Every failure (missing key, HTTP error,
  no route found) raises `fetchers.BrowserFetchError` — reused from the
  Browser tab despite the name, per its own docstring ("caught by main.py
  and shown via notify()") — and, unlike `run_search`'s silent DuckDuckGo
  fallback, there's no fallback provider for driving directions, so every
  failure surfaces as a `notify(severity="error")` instead of degrading
  quietly. `RichLog#nav-log` (`markup=False`, read-only sequential text, no
  per-row action)
  shows the numbered step list; `Static#nav-summary` shows the route
  total. `Button#nav-export` writes the current itinerary to a plain-text
  file via module-level `_export_itinerary` (runs synchronously on the
  main thread — a small local write, no worker needed) at
  `platformdirs.user_documents_dir()/google-tui/route_<origin>_to_
  <destination>_<timestamp>.txt`; `self._nav_last_result: fetchers.
  RouteResult | None` (new `__init__` attribute) backs Export, and is
  `None` until a route has actually been computed this session (Export
  before then just notifies a warning). Fetch/apply split
  (`_nav_fetch_thread`/`_nav_apply_result`/`_nav_apply_error`) follows the
  Browser tab's `_browser_fetch_thread`/`_browser_apply_document` pattern
  exactly: `run_worker(fn, thread=True, exclusive=True, group="nav-fetch")`
  + `call_from_thread` back to the main thread for all widget mutation.
  Configured in a new Settings sub-tab (`settings-tab-navigation`,
  `Input#settings-routes-key` + `Button#settings-save-routes`, backing
  `Settings.routes_api_key`) — see the Settings tab entry below.
- **Settings tab** (`Ctrl+7`): nested `TabbedContent#settings-tabs` (mirrors
  the Calendar tab's `#cal-tabs` Month/Week pattern), five sub-tabs,
  `Alt+Left/Right` cycles between them while the Settings tab is active
  (`_cycle_settings_tab`, modeled on `_cycle_tab`, targets
  `SETTINGS_TAB_ORDER = ["settings-tab-general", "settings-tab-ai",
  "settings-tab-feeds", "settings-tab-search", "settings-tab-navigation"]`
  instead of `TAB_ORDER`).
  Each sub-tab's content is wrapped in its own `VerticalScroll` (independent
  scrolling per section, not one giant outer scroll around the whole
  `TabbedContent`):
  - `TabPane#settings-tab-general`: `Button#settings-reauth-google` (in-app
    Google OAuth re-authorization — see below) + `Input#settings-browser-home-url`
    / `Button#settings-save-browser-home` (Browser tab's `Alt+H` home URL,
    P2, 2026-07-15 — backs `Settings.browser_home_url`, same
    Input+save-button pattern as the Nous/Routes API key rows) +
    `Switch#settings-encrypt-switch`
    (encrypt-at-rest on/off) + `RadioSet#settings-key-method` (passphrase
    vs. keyfile, hidden via `.hidden` CSS class when encryption is off) + a
    "Clear local cache now" button + a `Static` showing the cache file's
    path/size (see §1a for the encryption model this drives).
  - `TabPane#settings-tab-ai`: `RadioSet#settings-ai-provider` (AI provider
    for the Hermes Ask pane) + `Input#settings-nous-key` /
    `Button#settings-save-nous-key`.
  - `TabPane#settings-tab-feeds`: a News-feed subscription manager
    (`ListView#settings-feed-list` + `Input#settings-feed-url` +
    `Button#settings-add-feed` + `Button#settings-remove-feed`) that edits
    `Settings.feed_urls` directly (append/remove + `save_settings`) and kicks
    a one-off background fetch (`_fetch_and_merge_one_feed`, `thread=True`,
    group `"news-fetch-one"`) for a newly-added feed so the News tab isn't
    empty for it until the next full refresh.
  - `TabPane#settings-tab-search` (Browser tab search provider, added
    2026-07-14): `RadioSet#settings-search-provider`
    (`rb-search-google`/`rb-search-duckduckgo`/`rb-search-searxng`, backing
    `Settings.search_provider`) + two conditionally-`.hidden` groups
    (`#settings-google-group`: `Input#settings-google-cse-key` +
    `Input#settings-google-cse-id`; `#settings-searxng-group`:
    `Input#settings-searxng-url`) that `on_radio_set_changed`'s
    `settings-search-provider` branch shows/hides based on the current
    selection (both can be hidden at once, when DuckDuckGo is selected) +
    `Button#settings-save-search`. See the Browser tab entry above and
    CHANGELOG `[2026-07-14]` for the search backends this configures.
  - `TabPane#settings-tab-navigation` (Navigation tab's Routes API key,
    P1 M6): `Input#settings-routes-key` (password-masked) +
    `Button#settings-save-routes`, backing `Settings.routes_api_key`. A
    `Static` note points at SETUP.md §6 (Cloud Billing must be linked for
    the Routes API — it's part of paid Google Maps Platform, unlike the
    Workspace APIs the rest of this app uses).
- **Contacts tab** (`Ctrl+8`, P1 M5): `Input#contacts-search` + `Button
  #contacts-refresh` in a `Horizontal #contacts-bar`, above `ListView
  #contacts-list` (lightbar, same pattern as Email/News/Tasks). The
  standalone blank-compose entry point used to live here as `Button
  #contacts-compose-new`; it moved to the Email pane's `c` binding since a
  no-prefill compose is Email's job, not Contacts' — per-contact "Compose
  Email" (prefilled `to`) stayed put, see below. Backed by a new
  `gauth.list_contacts(svc)` (People API
  `people.connections().list(resourceName="people/me", personFields=
  "names,emailAddresses,phoneNumbers", pageSize=1000)`, paginated via
  `pageToken`, returns `{resource_name, name, email, phone}` dicts) through
  a new `"people"` service added to `gauth.services()`. Deliberately does
  NOT call `otherContacts.list` (Gmail-derived auto-contacts) — needs a
  separate `contacts.other.readonly` scope not requested by this project.
  Requires the `contacts.readonly` scope (added to `SETUP.md` §7's scope
  list); a token minted before that scope existed gets a 403 from
  `list_contacts`, caught in `_contacts_fetch_thread` and surfaced as an
  actionable `notify(severity="error")` ("re-run the OAuth flow... see
  SETUP.md §7") instead of crashing the tab — this WILL fire against a
  pre-existing token until it's re-minted. Fetched LAZILY: only on the
  Contacts tab's first activation (`self._contacts_fetch_started` guard in
  `on_tabbed_content_tab_activated`), not on every startup/`Ctrl+R` like
  mail/calendar/drive/news — contacts change far less often, and a full
  fetch is one `connections.list` call (not Gmail's N-sequential-calls
  pattern), so eager fetching wasn't worth the extra startup latency. Also
  triggerable manually via `Button#contacts-refresh`. Cached offline in a
  new `Cache` category `"contact"` (keyed by `resource_name`) per §1a/§8's
  pattern. `Input#contacts-search`'s `Input.Changed` re-filters
  `self._contacts_cache` client-side via `rapidfuzz.fuzz.partial_ratio`
  against `"name email"` (module-level `_fuzzy_filter_contacts` helper) —
  never re-queries Google per keystroke. `Enter`/`Space` on a highlighted
  contact opens `ContactModal` (name/email/phone + "Compose Email", which
  dismisses `("compose", email)` and is relayed via
  `_on_contact_modal_result` → `_open_compose_new(email)`, same
  `push_screen(..., callback)` + `call_after_refresh` deferral pattern as
  every other modal-result relay in this app — see the push_screen timing
  NOTE below). The Email pane's `c` binding (`action_compose_new`) calls
  the same `_open_compose_new()` with no `to` prefill. New `rapidfuzz`
  dependency (`pyproject.toml`) — same helper also powers Compose's To-field
  autocomplete, see the ComposeModal note below.
- **In-app Google re-authorization** (`Button#settings-reauth-google` in
  Settings → General, and `Button#onboarding-reauth-google` in
  `OnboardingWizardModal` when `"google"` is a diagnosed problem — see
  `_diagnose_setup`). Replaces the old process of writing and running a
  one-off OAuth script by hand (SETUP.md §7) for the two cases that used
  to require it: the routine **7-day token expiry** (Testing-status Google
  Cloud apps — SETUP.md §4) and adding a new scope to an existing token
  (e.g. `contacts.readonly` for P1 M5).

  `_diagnose_setup` only runs once, at startup — it can't catch a
  refresh_token that dies hours into an already-running session (this app
  is routinely left running for days). `_live_refresh_thread` (2026-07-16)
  covers that case too: `_google_auth_broken_detail()` calls
  `gauth.get_credentials()` fresh and specifically catches
  `google.auth.exceptions.RefreshError` (a dead/missing refresh_token or a
  revoked grant) as distinct from `_google_creds_ok()`'s existing catch-all,
  which can't tell a dead token apart from a plain network hiccup. If it
  IS a dead token, `_live_refresh_thread` skips its five (doomed) fetch
  attempts entirely and shows one notify pointing at Settings → General →
  "Re-authorize Google account" instead of the five near-identical raw
  `RefreshError` strings a per-section catch used to produce. Runs at the
  top of `_live_refresh_thread`, so it covers all three callers (startup,
  manual `Ctrl+R`, and the post-mutation refresh after a task toggle)
  from one place.

  **Deliberately NOT** `InstalledAppFlow.run_local_server()` (spawn a local
  HTTP server, auto-open a system browser, block until the redirect hits
  it) — this app commonly runs on a **headless VM** or an underpowered
  laptop with no X11/Wayland compositor, where there's no browser to open,
  and even opening the URL on a different device (a phone) could never
  reach a server listening on the headless machine's own `localhost`.
  Instead a manual copy-URL/paste-code flow, entirely inside
  `GoogleReauthModal` (`main.py`):
  1. `gauth.build_reauth_flow(scopes=None)` — reads `client_id`/
     `client_secret`/`token_uri` out of the EXISTING `TOKEN_PATH` (so the
     user never re-supplies their downloaded OAuth client JSON — only a
     genuinely first-ever setup, no `TOKEN_PATH` at all, still needs
     SETUP.md's manual walkthrough; this raises a clear error pointing at
     it instead of trying to build a "paste your client_secret.json into
     the TUI" flow, judged not worth the complexity for a once-ever step),
     builds an `InstalledAppFlow`, and sets `flow.redirect_uri =
     "http://localhost"` — a placeholder Google's "Desktop app" OAuth
     client type always accepts without pre-registration (RFC 8252
     loopback exception); nothing ever actually listens there. Local/no
     network — safe on the main thread, called from `GoogleReauthModal.
     __init__` directly (not a worker).
  2. `gauth.reauth_authorization_url(flow)` — `flow.authorization_url
     (access_type="offline", prompt="consent")`. Both kwargs are REQUIRED:
     without them, a RE-consent (the normal case here — the user already
     granted access once before) very often does NOT come back with a
     `refresh_token` at all, since Google only issues one on a truly
     first-ever consent by default, and a re-auth's whole point is
     replacing a dead one. Also local/no-network, safe on the main thread.
     The modal shows this URL as PLAIN text (`Static(..., markup=False)`
     — see the widget-level NOTE below for why not a `[link=...]` markup
     tag), with instructions: open it on ANY device with ANY browser, sign
     in, and expect the resulting redirect to FAIL to load ("can't reach
     this page") since nothing listens at `http://localhost` — that's
     correct, not a bug; the query string it failed to load is what gets
     pasted back.
  3. User pastes either the full failed-redirect URL or just its `code=`
     value into `Input#reauth-code-input`; `gauth.complete_reauth(flow,
     pasted)` sniffs which (`"://" in pasted`) and calls `flow.fetch_token
     (authorization_response=pasted)` or `flow.fetch_token(code=pasted)`
     accordingly, then writes `flow.credentials.to_json()` to `TOKEN_PATH`.
     THIS step hits the network (the actual token exchange with Google) —
     runs on a worker thread (`run_worker(..., thread=True)`), same rule as
     every other gauth call. Must reuse the SAME `flow` object step 1
     created (it carries the OAuth `state` from step 2, needed to validate
     a full pasted URL) — `GoogleReauthModal` holds it as `self.flow`
     across both steps; don't rebuild a fresh flow for step 3.
  Module-level `os.environ.setdefault("OAUTHLIB_INSECURE_TRANSPORT", "1")`
  in `gauth.py`: required because the placeholder redirect is `http://` not
  `https://` — oauthlib refuses to parse a pasted redirect URL against an
  insecure scheme otherwise. Safe here since the loopback leg is never
  actually connected to; only the real exchange with Google's (https) token
  endpoint matters, and that's unaffected by this flag.
  New `google-auth-oauthlib` dependency (`pyproject.toml`) — imported
  lazily inside `build_reauth_flow()`, not at `gauth.py` module level,
  since nothing else in this app needs it.
  **Widget-level NOTE**: the auth-URL `Static` is `markup=False` — Textual's
  own markup parser (`Content.from_markup`, not Rich's) throws a
  `MarkupError` on `://` inside a `[link=...]` tag value (confirmed
  empirically; same family of gotcha as the News tab's bracketed-feed-title
  issue elsewhere in this file). Plain text is the correct fix here too,
  not escaping — most terminals auto-linkify bare URLs in plain output on
  their own, and native mouse-drag selection works on it either way, which
  covers "copy or click" without fighting the markup parser for a cosmetic
  OSC-8 hyperlink tag.
  On success (`GoogleReauthModal` dismisses `"reauthorized"`),
  `GoogleTUI._apply_google_reauth_success` does NOT ask for a restart like
  the encrypt-at-rest settings do (§7) — it rebuilds `self.svc = gauth.
  services()` and kicks `_live_refresh_thread` immediately, since re-auth
  touches neither the cache nor the encryption key. If triggered from
  `OnboardingWizardModal`, `GoogleReauthModal` is pushed ON TOP of it
  (stacked modals); success dismisses BOTH (`isinstance(self.screen,
  OnboardingWizardModal)` check) via the same `push_screen(..., callback)`
  timing the rest of this app's modal-result relays use.
  **Known limitation, not fixed**: still assumes SOME browser, on SOME
  device, can reach the public internet to complete Google's consent
  screen — obviously true in practice, just noting this app's own machine
  never needs to be that device, which is the entire point of this design
  versus `run_local_server()`.

## 2. Key bindings

The actual keymap, help-bar text (both rows), and `HelpModal`'s reference
text are now generated from `google_tui/bindings.py` — a single
`ActionSpec` registry — instead of living independently in `main.py`'s
`BINDINGS`, `HELP_GLOBAL`, `_context_help_text()`, and `HELP_TEXT` the way
they used to. Edit `bindings.py` when adding/changing a shortcut; the table
below is a human-readable summary of it, not a second source of truth.

`ThreadModal` (opened via `Enter` on a thread) now has its own real
`r`/`a`/`f` bindings (`bindings.bindings_for_scope("modal:ThreadModal")`),
with the Reply/Reply All/Forward buttons showing the shortcut in their
label. Previously these keys were dead while the modal was open — Textual
truncates the binding-chain walk at a `ModalScreen` boundary, so the
App-level `r`/`a`/`f` bindings never reached it.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `F1..F8` | switch **tab** (Mail / Calendar / Drive / Browser / News / Navigation / Settings / Contacts) — also bound as `Ctrl+1..8`, a secondary alias (see caveat below) |
| `Ctrl+Left/Right` | cycle tabs — the universal fallback if neither `F1..F8` nor `Ctrl+1..8` reaches the app (see caveat below) |
| `Alt+1..4` | jump to a Mail **pane** (Email / Events / Tasks / Hermes); switches to the Mail tab first if needed |
| `Alt+Left/Right/Up/Down` | move to the adjacent Mail pane (see `PANE_ADJACENCY` below) on the Mail tab; back/forward through session history on the Browser tab; cycle Settings sub-tabs (General/AI Provider/News Feeds/Search/Navigation) on the Settings tab (`Alt+Up/Down` still only does Mail-pane adjacency — no vertical cycling defined for Settings) |
| `Alt+H` | Browser tab: jump to the configured home URL (`Settings.browser_home_url`, Settings → General) — no-op elsewhere |
| `Tab` / `Shift+Tab` | cycle Mail panes (no-op outside the Mail tab) |
| `l` | focus + open `Select#email-label-select`'s dropdown (Email pane only — no-op elsewhere) |
| `c` | compose new (Email pane only — no-op elsewhere; blank `ComposeModal(mode="new")`, same as the old `contacts-compose-new` button, which moved here) |
| `r` `a` `f` | reply / reply-all / forward (Email pane) — blocked with a warning notify while offline |
| `Space` | contextual (`action_context_space`): expand/collapse the highlighted row in place (Email — see `_toggle_thread_expand`, NOT `ThreadModal`), toggle complete (Tasks — blocked while offline), event detail (Events); no-op elsewhere |
| `Enter` | open selected item's detail (`ListView.Selected` / `DataTable.CellSelected`) |
| `[` `]` | previous / next month, or week if the Week sub-tab is active (Calendar tab only — no-op on other tabs) |
| `Ctrl+R` | reconnect / refresh all data (same code path as the background sync on startup) |
| `Ctrl+P` | command palette (Textual's own default binding, not declared in `BINDINGS`) |
| `Ctrl+H` | `HelpModal` — full reference, grouped by tab |
| `Ctrl+Q` / `Esc` | quit / close modal |

**Tab number display:** the confirmed design is "always show, dimmed" —
`_tab_label()` appends a `[dim]` superscript digit to each tab title, and
`_pane_title_row()` renders a two-`Label` row (title `width: 1fr`, number
`width: auto`, both styled) for Mail panes. This is NOT hide-until-modifier-
held: Textual 8.2.8's `events.py` has only one keyboard event class (`Key`,
press-only) — there is no key-release event and no exposed Kitty-protocol
modifier tracking, so "numbers appear only while Ctrl/Alt is held" cannot be
implemented in this Textual version. Don't attempt to "fix" this later
without re-checking whether Textual has since added key-release support.

**`Ctrl+1..8` terminal caveat, and the F1..F8 fix (2026-07-16):** most
terminals (and browser-based terminals especially — Chrome/Firefox/Edge
reserve `Ctrl+1..8` for switching *browser* tabs, intercepting the keystroke
before it ever reaches the terminal) don't reliably transmit `Ctrl+<digit>`
at all; only terminals with `modifyOtherKeys` or the Kitty keyboard protocol
enabled do (confirmed via `ANSI_SEQUENCES_KEYS` in this Textual version —
the sequences exist and are mapped, but most terminals never send them).
Unlike the `Alt+Arrow` double-ESC bug elsewhere in this file, this one has no
in-app fix — it's what the terminal transmits, or doesn't, before the app
ever sees a keystroke. Instead of trying to force `Ctrl+<digit>` to work
everywhere, `bindings.py`'s `GLOBAL_ACTIONS` now gives each `goto_tab_*`
action TWO keys via `Binding`'s comma-separated `key` field (e.g.
`"f1,ctrl+1"` for `goto_tab_mail`) — bare `F1..F8` is the primary binding
(SSH-safe: unlike `Ctrl+<digit>`, a bare function key is a single well-known
escape sequence every terminal/multiplexer forwards), `Ctrl+1..8` stays as a
secondary alias for the terminals that do support it. `Ctrl+Left/Right`
(`Ctrl+Arrow`) remains the universal last-resort fallback for the rare
terminal/window-manager combo that intercepts F-keys too (e.g. a WM's
fullscreen-toggle bindings).

**F2 was already taken:** `action_toggle_mouse` (release/recapture the
mouse for native terminal copy-paste) used `f2` before this change. Since
Calendar is tab position 2, a straight `F1..F8` tab mapping would collide
with it directly — not a terminal quirk, an in-app conflict. Resolved by
moving `toggle_mouse` to `f12` (checked: no other binding used any of
F9..F12) rather than breaking the contiguous F1..F8-for-tabs scheme by
skipping F2. If you ever add a 9th tab or a new global F-key binding, check
`GLOBAL_ACTIONS` in `bindings.py` for collisions first — Textual's `Binding`
doesn't warn on duplicate keys, it just makes the first-registered one win.

**`Alt+Left/Right/Up/Down` terminal caveat, and how it's actually fixed
(2026-07-15):** unlike the `Ctrl+1..8` caveat above, this one WAS fixable in
app code. Some terminals encode Alt+Arrow as a literal double-ESC sequence
(`ESC ESC [ A/B/C/D`) instead of the CSI-with-modifier-parameter form
(`ESC [ 1;3 A/B/C/D`). Confirmed by feeding both forms directly through
Textual 8.2.8's `XTermParser` (`google_tui/main.py`'s repro comment above
`_ESCAPE_ALT_ARROW_ACTIONS` has the full story): the CSI-1;3 form correctly
yields one `Key(key='alt+left', ...)`, but the double-ESC form hits a
hardcoded `process_alt=False` in `_xterm_parser.py` (triggered when a second
ESC interrupts the still-unresolved first escape sequence) and instead
yields TWO independent bare events — `Key('escape', ...)` then
`Key('left', ...)`. `pilot.press("alt+left")` cannot reproduce this class of
bug at all: it posts a pre-parsed combined key directly, bypassing
`XTermParser` entirely — reproduce terminal-encoding bugs like this by
feeding raw bytes through `textual._xterm_parser.XTermParser` directly, or
by posting the two `events.Key` objects it actually emits back-to-back (see
CHANGELOG `[2026-07-15]`'s Verified section). Fixed with `GoogleTUI.on_key`:
it tracks the timestamp of a lone `escape` event, and if the very next event
is a bare `left`/`right`/`up`/`down` within 50ms, treats it as the intended
`alt+<direction>` and calls `event.prevent_default()` to suppress
`App._on_key`'s own binding walk (which would otherwise run whatever bare
`left`/`right` binding the focused widget has, e.g. `Input`'s cursor move) —
same runs-before-base-class-and-can-suppress-it mechanism as
`GtHeader._on_click` below. This is NOT Browser-tab-specific — it
transparently fixes the same dead-Alt-arrow symptom for Mail-pane
navigation and Settings sub-tab cycling too, on any terminal using the
double-ESC encoding.

**`PANE_ADJACENCY`** (replaces an older `active ± 1` / `active ± 2`
arithmetic scheme that assumed a symmetric 2x2 grid): Email spans the full
left column; Events/Tasks/Hermes stack in the right column. This is an
explicit `{pane: {direction: pane}}` map, not arithmetic — see `main.py`
near `PANE_ADJACENCY`. If you add a 5th Mail pane, update this map, not a
formula.

NOTE on Textual selection model: `ListView.Highlighted` (capital H) is the
cursor index setter; `ListView.highlighted_child` (read-only) is the selected
ListItem. A `ListView` only has a `highlighted_child` after the cursor has
moved via key/message (e.g. `pilot.press("down")`), not by setting the
attribute directly. This matters for tests — see §6.

NOTE on `TabbedContent`: there are THREE `TabbedContent` widgets in the DOM
(`#main-tabs` outer, `#cal-tabs` nested inside the Calendar tab,
`#settings-tabs` nested inside the Settings tab). A bare
`self.query_one(TabbedContent)` raises `TooManyMatches` — always query by ID
(`self._main_tabs()` helper, or `self.query_one("#cal-tabs", TabbedContent)`,
or `self.query_one("#settings-tabs", TabbedContent)`).
`on_tabbed_content_tab_activated` must check `event.tabbed_content.id` before
acting, since all three post the same `TabbedContent.TabActivated` message —
the existing guard (`if event.tabbed_content.id != "main-tabs": return`)
already correctly no-ops for `#settings-tabs` sub-tab activation the same
way it already did for `#cal-tabs`; no new branch was needed when
`#settings-tabs` was added.

NOTE on `TabPane`/`Tab` titles: pass a **markup string** (e.g.
`"Mail [dim]¹[/dim]"`), not a `rich.text.Text` object. Textual 8.2.8's
`Widget.render_str()` always routes through `Content.from_markup()` unless
the input is already a Textual `Content` instance — a Rich `Text` object hits
`Content.from_markup()` too and blows up (`AttributeError: 'Text' object has
no attribute 'translate'`) instead of being passed through.

NOTE on overriding a Textual-internal `_on_xxx` handler (e.g. `Header.
_on_click`): a bare no-op override in a subclass does **NOT** suppress the
base class's handler. `MessagePump._get_dispatch_methods()` walks the
FULL MRO and, for naming-convention handlers (`_on_click` etc., as opposed
to `@on`-decorated ones), invokes the method from **every** class in the
MRO that defines one — there's no dedup, unlike the decorated-handler path.
Confirmed empirically: `class GtHeader(Header): def _on_click(self): pass`
still let `Header._on_click`'s `toggle_class("-tall")` run right after it,
because both `GtHeader._on_click` and `Header._on_click` get dispatched for
the same click. The actual fix is `event.prevent_default()` — its docstring
says exactly "prevent handlers in any base classes from being called", and
`_get_dispatch_methods` checks `message._no_default_action` at the top of
each MRO-loop iteration and `break`s before reaching the base class's
handler. `main.py`'s `GtHeader` (disables `Header`'s click-to-grow-3-rows
behavior) uses this pattern; if you ever override another built-in
`_on_xxx` handler, use `event.prevent_default()`, not a no-op body, and
verify with a live pilot click (see the `pilot.click` offset gotcha in §6)
rather than trusting it by inspection.

NOTE on `App.query_one`/`App.query` and screens: they resolve against
`self.screen`, i.e. the CURRENTLY ACTIVE (top-of-stack) screen — not the base
app screen. Cost real debugging time once already: a worker callback tried to
`self.query_one("#email-list")` while `LoadingModal` was still on top of the
stack and got `NoMatches("... on Screen(id='_default')")` even though
`#email-list` obviously exists — it exists on the base screen, which wasn't
current. Fix: dismiss any modal FIRST, then query/populate widgets. Any
future modal shown during startup (or any worker that might run while a
modal is up) needs this same ordering.

NOTE on the startup/refresh worker (`_start_after_unlock` → `_load_from_cache`
→ `_live_refresh_thread` → `_apply_live_refresh`): Gmail/Calendar/Drive calls
are blocking synchronous httplib2 calls, not asyncio-native — an `async def`
worker with no real `await` inside doesn't yield control back to the loop,
so it can't paint anything (like `LoadingModal`) before it finishes. That's
why **every** gauth-touching worker runs via `run_worker(fn, thread=True)` (a
real OS thread) and never as a plain `async def`. Textual widgets are NOT
thread-safe (`App.call_from_thread`'s own docstring says so) — every
gauth-touching method is split into a `_fetch_*` half (pure data, safe to
call from the worker thread — also safe to call `Cache` methods from there,
they're lock-guarded) and an `_apply_*` half (widget mutation, must run via
`self.call_from_thread(...)` back on the main thread). If you add a 6th data
source, follow this same fetch/apply split; don't call `gauth.*` and mutate
a widget in the same method if that method might ever run off the main
thread.

**`async def` + blocking I/O is the bug that made this app feel broken.** An
`async def` worker does NOT get its own thread: it runs ON the event loop, so
a blocking `gauth.*` / `requests` call inside one freezes the entire UI —
keystrokes, repaints, everything — until the network answers. Four workers
were written that way and all four have been converted to `thread=True`
(2026-07-14): `refresh_all` → `_refresh_all_thread` (post-send/post-task-toggle
refresh), `_hermes_worker` → `_hermes_thread` (LLM round-trip), `_drive_preview`
→ `_drive_preview_thread`, and the inline `gauth.set_task_status()` call in
`action_toggle_task`. If you add a worker that touches the network, it takes
`thread=True`. There is no exception to this.

Two hot handlers are also **debounced**, because they fire on every keypress
and each one did real work per key: `_drive_on_highlight` (a Drive preview is a
metadata round-trip *plus* a file download — arrowing through a folder fired one
per row) and the Contacts search box (fuzzy-matches the whole address book and
rebuilds every row). Both restart a timer instead of stacking work; Drive
previews are additionally memoised per session in `_drive_preview_cache`.

Populate `ListView`s with `extend(items)`, never `append()` in a loop —
`append` mounts one widget per call (mount + layout + repaint each), so an
80-row inbox paid 80 separate mount cycles. `extend` batches them into one.

`gauth.list_threads()` used to issue one sequential `threads().get()` per
thread — ~160 round-trips at `max_results=80`, measured at **~20 seconds**. It
now issues them through Gmail's HTTP **batch** endpoint (`new_batch_http_request`,
50 sub-requests per call), so the same fetch is 2 round-trips. Order is
preserved and a failed sub-request is skipped rather than sinking the list.
Keep any new per-item Google fetch batched the same way. (Pagination is still
tracked as a P2 ROADMAP item; that's a separate concern from call count.)

**Revalidate, don't refetch.** The cache is not just an offline fallback — it is
the thing that keeps refreshes cheap, and every cached category now carries a
change token so we can prove a cached row is current without downloading it:

| data | token | source |
|---|---|---|
| thread summary (`thread_summary:*`) | `historyId` | already in the `threads().list` response |
| thread body (`thread_body`) | the thread's `historyId` | the cached summary row |
| drive meta/text (`drive_file_*`) | `modifiedTime` | already in the `files().list` listing |

Both tokens are bumped by Google on *any* change to the underlying object, and
both arrive **free** in a list call we were making anyway. So: pass the cached
rows in (`list_threads(..., known=...)`), compare the token, and reuse the
cached row when it matches. A refresh where nothing changed costs one API call.
If you add a new cached category, find its change token and do the same — and
treat a cached row with a *missing* token as stale (rows written by older
versions have none; reuse only what you can prove is current).

NOTE on `push_screen(screen, callback)` timing: the callback fires **before**
the screen is actually popped (confirmed by reading `Screen.dismiss` in this
Textual version: it calls the result callback, THEN `self.app.pop_screen()`)
— NOT after, like you'd assume. A callback that does `self.query_one(...)`
immediately hits the same "wrong screen" `NoMatches` described above.
`_on_startup_unlock_result` and `_on_settings_passphrase_result` both defer
their actual work one step via `self.call_after_refresh(...)` for exactly
this reason. Do the same for any new modal-with-callback flow.

NOTE on `ListView.clear()`: it returns an `AwaitRemove` — removal is NOT
synchronous, and for a bulk removal (dozens of items) it can take LONGER
than a single `call_after_refresh` cycle to actually finish. This only bit
us once mail/drive data started being applied TWICE per session (cache load,
then live refresh, both with the same item IDs): a fire-and-forget
`clear()` + `call_after_refresh(populate)` pattern raised `DuplicateIds`
intermittently, because the second populate's items were inserted before
the first populate's identically-IDed items had actually been removed.
Fixed in `_apply_mail_data_async`/`_apply_drive_files_async` by `await`ing
`clear()` properly inside a `run_worker(..., exclusive=True, group=...)`
coroutine, plus a generation counter (`_mail_apply_gen`/`_drive_apply_gen`)
as a second safety net so a stale, superseded populate is a no-op instead of
racing. If you add another category that gets applied more than once per
session, use this same pattern — don't go back to bare `.clear()` +
`call_after_refresh`.

NOTE: `ModalScreen.Dismissed` does **not exist** in this Textual version
(`hasattr(ModalScreen, "Dismissed")` is `False`) — `on_dismiss(self, event:
ModalScreen.Dismissed)` in `GoogleTUI` type-checks fine only because
`from __future__ import annotations` makes it a string, never evaluated.
This means `on_dismiss` is very likely **dead code that Textual never
calls** in this version (there's no message class for it to dispatch on).
It was NOT touched this round (out of scope), but if `ThreadModal`'s
Reply/Reply All/Forward buttons ever seem to silently do nothing, this is
almost certainly why — the fix would be routing that result through
`push_screen(..., callback)` instead (mind the callback-timing NOTE above).

`cache.py` / `settings.py`: see §1a for the full design (categories, key
methods, canary verification). `CACHE_DB_PATH` = `platformdirs.
user_cache_dir("google-tui")/cache.db`; `KEY_FILE_PATH` and `SETTINGS_PATH`
= `platformdirs.user_config_dir("google-tui")/{cache.key,settings.json}`.

`gauth.py`:
- `services()` — returns cached `{gmail, calendar, tasks, drive}` via
  `Credentials.from_authorized_user_file(~/.hermes/google_token.json)` + builds
  the four `googleapiclient` resources. Refreshes a worker copy so the API
  client isn't shared across worker threads.
- `list_threads(svc, max_results, q)` — Gmail threads, formats `metadata`
  then `full` per thread for snippet/body/headers. Unread via `UNREAD` label.
  Each returned dict also carries `"snippet"` (Gmail message resources
  include a top-level `snippet` regardless of `format`, so this is free —
  no extra API call); backs the Email pane's Space-to-expand inline preview
  (`main.py`'s `_toggle_thread_expand`).
- `list_events(svc, days)` — Calendar `events.list` over next `days` days.
- `events_between(svc, start, end)` — generic date-range `events.list`;
  `month_events(svc, year, month)` and the Calendar tab's week grid both call
  this rather than duplicating the API-call shape.
- `list_tasklists(svc)` / `list_tasks(svc, list_id, show_completed)` — task
  lists and one list's items (caller tags each item with `_list`).
- `list_drive(svc, folder_id)` — Drive `files.list` in `folder_id` (or root).
- `get_file_metadata(svc, file_id)` — `files.get` with an expanded `fields`
  string (`owners`, `createdTime`, `modifiedTime`, `parents`, ...); backs the
  Drive tab's who/what/where/when preview panel.
- `read_drive_text(svc, file_id)` — returns `(name, mime, text)`; Google-native
  files exported via `files.export` (Docs→text/plain, Sheets→text/csv,
  Slides→text/plain), others fetched as bytes then decoded best-effort. Its
  `files().get(...)` call used the wrong keyword (`file_id=`) — the Google API
  discovery-generated method needs `fileId=` (camelCase). This is a real API
  parameter name, not a Python convention; grep for `file_id=` vs `fileId=`
  if a Drive call ever throws "unexpected keyword argument".
- `list_contacts(svc)` (P1 M5) — People API `people.connections().list`
  against `resourceName="people/me"`, paginated via `pageToken`, returns
  `{resource_name, name, email, phone}` dicts (first value of each
  possibly-multi-valued field, `""` if absent). Requires the
  `contacts.readonly` scope — raises on a token that doesn't have it; the
  caller (`main.py`'s `_contacts_fetch_thread`) catches and surfaces this.
- `GOOGLE_SCOPES` — the canonical scope list this app requests, kept in
  sync with SETUP.md §7 by convention (not by code — it's plain text there).
- `build_reauth_flow(scopes=None)` / `reauth_authorization_url(flow)` /
  `complete_reauth(flow, response_or_code)` — the three-step in-app Google
  OAuth re-authorization flow (headless-safe: manual copy-URL/paste-code,
  not `run_local_server()`); see the "In-app Google re-authorization" entry
  in §1 for the full design.
- `reply_to(...)`, `forward(...)`, `send_message(...)` (plain new-message
  send, backs `ComposeModal`'s `mode == "new"`, P1 M5), `set_task_status(...)`
  — MUTATING helpers.

`ask.py`:
- `ask_llm(question, ctx)` — POSTs to Nous inference endpoint
  (`https://inference-api.nousresearch.com/v1/chat/completions`,
  model `tencent/hy3:free`) using `NOUS_API_KEY` from `~/.hermes/config.yaml`.
  `ctx` is a prebuilt "Google snapshot" string.
- `needs_agent(q)` — keyword heuristic; if True, question is delegated to the
  full Hermes agent via `subprocess` shelling `hermes "<question>" --print`.
- `ask_hermes_agent(q)` — runs `hermes` and returns stdout.
- `build_ctx()` — pulls live threads/events/tasks into a compact text block
  for LLM context.
- `google_search(q)` (the old `hermes web search` shell-out) was REMOVED
  2026-07-14 — the Browser tab's Search mode now goes through
  `fetchers.run_search` instead (see the Browser tab entry in §1 and
  CHANGELOG). Don't recreate a search function here; `fetchers.py` owns all
  Browser-tab network I/O, search included.

`main.py`:
- `GoogleTUI(App)` — main screen. Holds `self.svc`, `self.settings`,
  `self._cache` (`Cache | None`, built once the encryption key is resolved),
  `self._online`, `self._tasks_cache`, `self._events_cache` (Mail-tab
  upcoming events), `self._threads_cache` (threadId -> thread dict,
  populated everywhere `_apply_email_list`/`_apply_mail_data_async` are —
  backs the Email pane's Space-to-expand lookup),
  `self._expanded_thread_ids` (`set[str]`, which threads are currently
  shown expanded; resets naturally on every list repopulate, no
  persistence), `self._cal_by_day` / `self._cal_week_cells`
  (Calendar-tab month/week grids), `self._drive_files` (Drive tab) — all
  populated so modal/preview reads don't need a fresh network round trip.
- `LoadingModal` — pushed only on a genuine first run (empty cache), by
  `_start_after_unlock`; dismissed by `_apply_live_refresh`.
- `UnlockModal` — passphrase entry, "unlock" (startup) and "create"
  (Settings tab) modes; see §1a.
- Every gauth-touching operation is split `_fetch_*` (pure data, thread-safe,
  also writes to `self._cache` when called from the live-refresh path) /
  `_apply_*` (widget mutation, main-thread only) — see the NOTEs on the
  startup/refresh worker above. `refresh_all()` (used after a task toggle)
  and `_live_refresh_thread` (startup + `Ctrl+R`) both call `_fetch_mail_data()`
  then `_write_mail_cache(...)` then `_apply_mail_data(...)`; same
  fetch/apply pattern for `_build_cal_month`/`_build_cal_week`/`_drive_load`.
  `_apply_mail_data`/`_apply_drive_files` can each now run TWICE per session
  (cache load, then live refresh) — see the `ListView.clear()` NOTE above for
  why they're `run_worker(..., exclusive=True)`-wrapped async methods with a
  generation counter, not plain synchronous clear+append.
- `_load_from_cache()` — reads every category via `Cache.get_all`/`get` and
  feeds the SAME `_apply_*` methods the live path uses; returns whether
  anything was found (decides whether `LoadingModal` is needed).
- Modals (all subclass `ModalScreen`): `OnboardingWizardModal` (forced
  first-run guidance), `GoogleReauthModal` (in-app OAuth re-auth, see the
  Google re-authorization entry below — can be pushed standalone or
  stacked on top of `OnboardingWizardModal`), `LoadingModal`, `UnlockModal`,
  `ThreadModal`, `ComposeModal`, `EventModal`, `TaskModal`, `DayEventsModal`
  (Calendar day/hour-slot overflow), `NewsEntryModal` (News tab, P1 M3),
  `ContactModal` (Contacts tab detail, P1 M5), `HelpModal` (`Ctrl+H`).
  `CalendarModal`/`DriveModal`/`DriveFileModal`/`SearchModal` from the
  pre-tab-redesign version are GONE — their content is inline in the
  Calendar/Drive/Search `TabPane`s now; do not recreate them as modals.
- `ThreadModal` (P1 M4 rewrite): no longer a single `RichLog#thread-body`.
  Each message is rendered through `render.parse_feed_entry` (HTML-sniffing
  — routes through `render.parse_html` when `gauth.get_thread`'s new
  `"html_body"` key is non-empty, else the plain-paragraph fallback) into a
  `Document`, mounted as its own `DocumentView` (`classes="thread-msg-doc"`,
  height forced to `"auto"` since `DocumentView`'s own `DEFAULT_CSS` sets
  `height: 1fr`, wrong when several are stacked in one `VerticalScroll`),
  preceded by a small From/Date `Static` header — all stacked in
  `#thread-messages`, oldest-first (unchanged order). NOT one merged
  `Document` per thread — see the P1 M4 CHANGELOG entry for why. `_apply_thread`
  is `async` (unlike this app's other `call_from_thread` targets) because it
  must `await container.mount(...)` before setting `.document =` on each
  `DocumentView` — a bare fire-and-forget `.mount()` races `watch_document`'s
  `query_one` calls on children that aren't mounted yet.
- `ComposeModal` (P1 M5 extension): gained `mode == "new"` (blank compose,
  `thread_id=None`, optional `to=` prefill param) alongside the existing
  `reply`/`reply_all`/`forward` modes — sent via a new `gauth.send_message`
  rather than `gauth.reply_to`/`forward`. `#c-to` has a live fuzzy-match
  suggestion `ListView#c-to-suggestions` (hidden when empty) sourced from
  `self.app._contacts_cache`, matching only the fragment after the last
  comma (so a partially-typed multi-recipient list still autocompletes);
  selecting a suggestion appends/replaces that fragment and re-focuses the
  input. No-ops silently (empty suggestion list) if contacts were never
  fetched — never errors.
- `_mk_id(prefix, raw)` — MODULE-LEVEL helper (NOT a method) that sanitizes a
  Google id (or, for News, a feed entry id — often a URL) into a valid
  Textual widget CSS id (`t-…`, `e-…`, `k-…`, `d-…`, `n-…`, `sf-…`).
  MUST stay module-level: do not re-indent it into the class body, and do not
  name any method `_id` (collides with Textual's internal `DOMNode._id`).
- Module-level helpers: `_fmt_date(s)`, `_mk_id`, `_feed_list_item(url)`
  (News-feed subscription row, stashes the raw URL as a `.feed_url`
  attribute since `_mk_id` can't be reversed for a URL-shaped id),
  `_tab_label(text, num)`, `_event_day(e)`, `_is_previewable(mime)`,
  `_email_collapsed_line(th)` (the one-line collapsed row format shared by
  `_append_email_items` and `_toggle_thread_expand`'s collapse path).
- `GtHeader(Header)` — module-level class (not a method), disables
  Textual's built-in click-to-grow-3-rows `Header` behavior via
  `event.prevent_default()` in an overridden `_on_click`; see the MRO-
  dispatch NOTE in §2 for why a naive no-op override doesn't work. Used in
  `compose()` in place of a bare `Header()`.

## 4. Auth & secrets

- Token: `~/.hermes/google_token.json` (OAuth, has `refresh_token` + Gmail/
  Calendar/Drive/Tasks scopes). `google_client_secret.json` was NOT found —
  token is long-lived.
- Why a custom wrapper: the bundled `google-workspace` skill's
  `scripts/google_api.py` does NOT implement the `tasks` service and Drive has
  no `list` subcommand. So this project talks to the Google APIs directly via
  `google-api-python-client` using the already-valid token.
- Nous key: read from `~/.hermes/config.yaml` (`keys.nous_api_key`) by
  `ask.py`. If missing, `ask_llm` raises a clear error.
- The skill's `gws` CLI and `scripts/google_api.py` are NOT used by this app.

## 5. How to run

```bash
cd /home/bradb/google-tui
. .venv/bin/activate            # optional — launcher does this for you
google-tui                     # works from ANY shell (see §7)
```

`google-tui` launcher: `/home/bradb/.local/bin/google-tui` (on PATH),
shell script that `exec`s `/home/bradb/google-tui/.venv/bin/python -m google_tui`.
If the project folder moves, update the `VENV=` path in that launcher.

### Startup update check (`updater.py`)

`main()` runs `updater.check_for_update()` on the console **before** the Textual
app starts, then `updater.restart()` (an `os.execv`) if it pulled anything. It
is deliberately outside the TUI: the messages are plain stdout lines, and an
update only actually takes effect after a re-exec — this interpreter has already
imported the old modules, so pulling new code without restarting would report an
update that isn't the one running.

Because this is code that rewrites its own checkout, the rules are strict and
you should not relax them without a very good reason:

* **Never touch uncommitted work.** A modified *tracked* file skips the check
  entirely. (Untracked files don't block it — `merge --ff-only` refuses safely
  rather than overwriting them, and counting them as dirty would mean a stray
  `__pycache__` wedges the updater forever.)
* **Fast-forward only.** Never merge, rebase, or reset. A diverged branch is a
  human's problem; say so and move on.
* **Never block startup.** Every git call is timeout-bounded and refuses
  interactive prompts (`GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0`); any failure whatsoever prints a
  line and launches the app anyway. A broken update check must never be the
  reason someone can't read their mail.

Disable with `--no-update`, `GOOGLE_TUI_NO_UPDATE=1`, or Settings → General.
It no-ops (reporting "no update") when the package isn't a git checkout.

### Versioning

`__version__` in `google_tui/__init__.py` is the source of truth;
`pyproject.toml` is kept in lockstep. **The patch version bumps on every
commit** — `hooks/pre-commit` runs `scripts/bump_version.py` and stages both
files, so the bump is part of the commit. Activate the hooks once per clone:

```bash
git config core.hooksPath hooks
```

Don't hand-edit the version to "fix" it; run `scripts/bump_version.py
--minor|--major` if you need a bigger jump. The hook deliberately no-ops during
merge/rebase/cherry-pick and when nothing is staged.

### Cache limits & pruning

`Cache.prune(max_age_days, max_bytes)` enforces the two opt-in limits in
Settings → General (`cache_retention_days`, `cache_max_mb`; both default 0 ==
unlimited). It runs on launch and whenever a limit changes, always on a worker
thread — the DELETEs are indexed and cheap but the `VACUUM` after them rewrites
the DB file, which is long enough to stutter the UI on a large cache.

Two invariants make eviction safe, and any new cached category must preserve
them:

* **Everything in the cache is refetchable.** Combined with the
  historyId/modifiedTime revalidation above, a pruned row silently re-fetches
  the next time it's needed. Never cache something that can't be reconstructed
  from Google, or pruning becomes data loss.
* **`updated_at` is a "last seen" stamp, not "first cached".** It's rewritten on
  every `put`, and every refresh re-puts the rows it still sees. That's what
  makes age-based pruning correct: rows still present upstream never age out;
  only rows that fell off the list (or content you haven't opened in months) do.
  If you ever make writes conditional to "save a write", you break this and
  age-based pruning starts deleting live data.

Always `VACUUM` after deleting — SQLite frees pages but doesn't shrink the file,
so without it the Settings size readout wouldn't move and the prune would look
like it did nothing.

**Keeping venv deps in sync across machines**: `pip install -e .` (README
Setup) only installs what `pyproject.toml` lists AT THAT MOMENT — a later
`git pull` that adds a new dependency (e.g. `feedparser` for the News tab,
P1 M3) does NOT retroactively install it, and the next launch crashes with
`ModuleNotFoundError` instead of failing informatively. Fixed with a tracked
`hooks/post-merge` hook (activate once per clone: `git config
core.hooksPath hooks`, also in the README) that re-runs `pip install -e .`
automatically whenever a pull touches `pyproject.toml`. If a machine's
`google-tui` fails on import with a missing module right after a pull, check
whether `core.hooksPath` is set there before assuming something else broke.

### Logging (`~/.local/state/google-tui/log/google-tui.log`)

`GoogleTUI.notify()` overrides `App.notify()` — every `notify()` call in the
app funnels through it (including from `ModalScreen`s, which proxy through
`Widget.notify` -> `self.app.notify`) — and appends `error`/`warning`
severity notifications to this file before showing the toast. `Google
TUI._handle_exception()` similarly overrides Textual's single choke point for
*every* unhandled exception (message-handler or worker; `run_worker` defaults
to `exit_on_error=True`) and logs the full traceback there before the app
exits. Check this file first for anything reported as "it crashed" or "I saw
an error toast but missed it" — a crash previously only ever reached the
terminal itself, which is easy to lose (confirmed: piping a run through `tee`
alone was enough to make one vanish with no trace at all, exit code 0).

## 6. Testing without a TTY

> **⚠️ Isolate config/cache paths before mounting `GoogleTUI` in ANY headless
> test/script, no exceptions.** `settings.py`/`cache.py` compute
> `SETTINGS_PATH`/`CACHE_DB_PATH`/`KEY_FILE_PATH` as module-level constants
> from `platformdirs.user_config_dir("google-tui")`/`user_cache_dir(
> "google-tui")` at import time — the SAME "google-tui" app name the real
> installed app uses. On a dev machine those resolve to the developer's
> actual `~/.config/google-tui`/`~/.cache/google-tui`. An earlier version of
> `scripts/generate_screenshot.py` called `shutil.rmtree()` on exactly those
> paths "to guarantee a clean slate," and a headless verification script
> copied that same pattern — between the two, a real user's settings.json
> and cache.db got wiped **twice**. There is no `ignore_errors=True` or
> "just don't rmtree the real one" fix that's actually safe, because the
> path being real in the first place is the bug. The only reliable fix:
> monkeypatch the `platformdirs` functions themselves to an isolated temp
> dir **before** importing anything from `google_tui` (module constants are
> computed once, at import time, so patching after the fact is too late):
> ```python
> import tempfile
> from pathlib import Path
> import platformdirs
> _ISOLATED_HOME = Path(tempfile.mkdtemp(prefix="google-tui-test-"))
> platformdirs.user_config_dir = lambda *a, **k: str(_ISOLATED_HOME / "config")
> platformdirs.user_cache_dir = lambda *a, **k: str(_ISOLATED_HOME / "cache")
> # only NOW import google_tui.settings / google_tui.cache / google_tui.main
> ```
> `scripts/generate_screenshot.py` does this — copy it, don't reinvent it.
> Never `shutil.rmtree()` a `platformdirs.user_*_dir()` result directly, ever.

Textual needs a real terminal, so headless tests use Textual's `run_test`
driver with a `pilot`. Pattern that works:

```python
async with app.run_test(size=(140, 44)) as pilot:
    await asyncio.sleep(2)                          # let workers populate
    app.action_goto_pane_email()
    await pilot.pause()
    await pilot.press("down")                       # move cursor → highlighted_child set
    await pilot.pause()
    await pilot.press("r")                          # reply → ComposeModal opens
    await pilot.pause()
    assert isinstance(app.screen, ModalScreen)
```

Use `app.save_screenshot(path)` at any point inside `run_test` to export an
SVG snapshot of the current render — the closest substitute for eyeballing a
live TTY app when you can't attach one. `pip install cairosvg` (into the
project `.venv`) to convert those to PNG for visual review.

**Regenerating `assets/screenshot.png`** (the README hero image, P1 M7):
run `scripts/generate_screenshot.py` — it's a self-contained version of this
exact pattern (fabricated dataset, `gauth.get_credentials`/`services`/every
`list_*`/`get_thread` call mocked so it needs no real token and makes zero
live API calls, `run_test` pilot, `save_screenshot` → `cairosvg`) that writes
straight to `assets/screenshot.png`:
```bash
.venv/bin/pip install cairosvg   # one-time, not a project dependency (see script docstring)
.venv/bin/python scripts/generate_screenshot.py
```
Re-run this whenever the Mail tab's visual design changes enough to make the
current screenshot look stale (new tab, changed pane layout, color scheme,
etc.) — not on every commit, and always eyeball the result before
committing (a Textual layout regression can still "succeed" while looking
wrong). The dataset lives in the script itself (module-level `FAKE_*`
constants) — edit those directly if you want different sample content;
don't reach for real account data, the whole point is that this asset is
safe to regenerate and share without ever touching a live token.

Gotchas that cost time before:
- Mock `ask.ask_llm`, `ask.ask_hermes_agent`,
  `fetchers.search_google_cse`/`search_duckduckgo`/`search_searxng` (or
  `fetchers.run_search` directly), and `gauth.reply_to`/`forward`/
  `send_message`/`set_task_status` in tests to avoid network + real email
  sends. Also mock `gauth.list_contacts` if the test's token doesn't have
  the `contacts.readonly` scope yet — otherwise the Contacts tab's fetch
  raises and the test only exercises the error-notify path. ALWAYS mock
  `gauth.build_reauth_flow`/`reauth_authorization_url`/`complete_reauth`
  too before clicking `#settings-reauth-google` or `#onboarding-reauth-google`
  — the real `complete_reauth` blocks on an actual network round trip to
  Google, which will hang any test/pilot run waiting on a fabricated code
  that was never really issued.
- Do NOT assert on `ListView.highlighted`/`highlighted_child` after setting the
  attribute directly (read-only setters differ between versions). Drive selection
  through key presses instead.
- There are three `TabbedContent`s in the DOM (`#main-tabs`, `#cal-tabs`,
  `#settings-tabs`) — use `app.query_one("#main-tabs")`, never a bare type
  query (see §2).
- `app.query_one`/`app.query` resolve against `self.screen` (see the NOTE in
  §2) — a pushed `ModalScreen` (e.g. `ThreadModal`) means widgets like
  `#thread-messages` must be reached via `app.screen.query_one(...)`, not
  `app.query_one(...)`, while that modal is on top of the stack.
- `pilot.click(SomeWidget)` with no `offset` clicks the widget's top-left
  corner, not its visual center — cost real debugging time once already on
  `GtHeader`/`Header`: the default offset landed on `HeaderIcon` (docked
  left, width 8), whose own `on_click` calls `event.stop()` and opens the
  command palette, so the click never even reached `Header`'s own handler —
  a test that "passed" for the wrong reason. Pass an explicit `offset=`
  (e.g. `(50, 0)`) to land on the part of the widget actually being tested.
- The Hermes Ask answer takes ~1s to stream into the RichLog; sleep 2s before
  asserting log line count.
- Run each `GoogleTUI()` test scenario in its OWN process (`python
  scenario_x.py`, not multiple `async with app.run_test()` blocks chained in
  one `asyncio.run(...)`). Chaining full app instances in one process left a
  background `thread=True` worker from a prior instance still in flight when
  the next instance mounted, and it reproducibly caused a `DuplicateIds`
  crash unrelated to the actual scenario being tested. Wipe
  `platformdirs.user_cache_dir("google-tui")` / `user_config_dir("google-tui")`
  between scenarios that need a clean cache (`shutil.rmtree(..., ignore_errors=True)`).
- To prime a cache for a "warm start" test, actually run a cold-start
  scenario first (real live data) rather than hand-crafting cache rows —
  the payload shapes (Gmail thread dict, Calendar event dict, etc.) are
  exactly what `gauth.*` returns, easy to get subtly wrong by hand.

## 7. Known caveats / open items

- **Contacts tab needs a token re-mint.** `gauth.list_contacts` (P1 M5)
  requires the `contacts.readonly` scope, added to `SETUP.md` §7's scope
  list when this shipped. Brad's live `~/.hermes/google_token.json` was
  minted before that — the Contacts tab will show the graceful
  "re-run the OAuth flow" error notify until it's regenerated with the new
  scope (a manual step, see SETUP.md §7 — a session can't do this itself,
  it needs a real browser consent flow).
- NO send confirmation: `ComposeModal` send fires `gauth.reply_to`/`forward`
  immediately. Not tested against the live API (would actually send mail).
  Recommended next step: add a confirmation step before send (see ROADMAP).
- Threads: only first 80 shown (metadata+full per thread). No threading UI
  beyond one level; no pagination beyond that.
- Calendar month grid (`#cal-grid`): `on_data_table_cell_selected` reads the
  day number off `event.value` (the first line of the multi-line cell text),
  not `event.coordinate` + a separate `get_cell_at` lookup — simpler and
  avoids the `update_cell`-with-integer-indices `CellDoesNotExist` trap the
  old modal-era code had to work around.
- Week view (`#cal-week-grid`) is **hour granularity**, not 30/15-minute — an
  event's summary is written into every hour row it spans, so sub-hour timing
  isn't visually precise. Documented follow-up in ROADMAP, not fixed here.
- Drive "up" always reloads root, not the true parent folder — a
  simplification carried over unchanged from the pre-tab-redesign DriveModal
  (fixing real parent-stack tracking is a separate, unrequested task).
- Drive preview is text-only for `_is_previewable()` mime types; images and
  other binaries show metadata + "no text preview" (no download-to-`less` or
  in-terminal image rendering — that would need `textual-image`, not
  currently a dependency).
- **FIXED 2026-07-14** (was open since M2): the Browser tab's Search mode
  used to shell out to `hermes web search`, a subcommand that no longer
  exists in the installed `hermes` CLI — it degraded to an empty-links
  Document instead of crashing, but was effectively dead. Replaced with
  real search backends (`fetchers.run_search` → Google Custom Search /
  DuckDuckGo / SearXNG, configurable in Settings' new Search sub-tab,
  DuckDuckGo as the no-config fallback). See the Browser tab entry in §1
  and CHANGELOG `[2026-07-14]` for the full design.
- LLM model is hardcoded `tencent/hy3:free`; change in `ask.py` only.
- Tab numbers are always-shown-dimmed, not hide-until-modifier-held — see the
  NOTE in §2 for why (no key-release event in Textual 8.2.8).
- Offline mode is READ-ONLY browsing of cached data, not a sync engine: no
  queued mutations, no automatic retry beyond `Ctrl+R`/next launch. See §1a.
- Changing the encrypt-at-rest switch or key method takes effect on the
  NEXT launch, not live — the running session keeps using whatever `Cache`
  object it already built. The cache is cleared immediately so stale rows
  under the old scheme can't linger, but a "restart to apply" notify is the
  only feedback; there's no in-session cache-object hot-swap. A genuine
  live-swap (rebuild `self._cache` with the new key without restarting)
  is a reasonable follow-up if the restart step proves annoying in practice.
- `on_dismiss(self, event: ModalScreen.Dismissed)` is almost certainly dead
  code in this Textual version — see the NOTE in §2. Not fixed this round
  (out of scope), but worth knowing before assuming Reply/Forward-from-
  ThreadModal works.
- News tab (P1 M3): removing a feed in Settings drops it from `Settings.
  feed_urls` and re-renders `#news-list` with that feed's entries filtered
  out, but does NOT delete its old rows from the `feed_entry` cache
  category — they just stop being fetched/shown until a full `Cache.
  clear_all()`. Harmless (a few stale SQLite rows), consistent with how
  Drive/mail data isn't actively pruned either, but worth knowing if a
  cache-size audit ever looks suspiciously large after a lot of
  add/remove churn. Also: a single unreachable feed URL notifies an error
  and is skipped (per-feed try/except in `_fetch_news_data`) but
  deliberately does NOT flip `self._online`/the Synced-Offline header —
  that flag is Google-reachability-specific (§1a); don't "fix" this by
  folding feed failures into the same `ok` flag as the Gmail/Calendar/Drive
  fetches in `_live_refresh_thread`.

## 8. Common tasks a future session might do

- Add a new Mail pane: add id to `PANE_IDS`/`PANE_TITLES`, a neighbor entry
  in `PANE_ADJACENCY`, a widget in `compose()`, an `action_goto_pane_<x>`,
  and bind `alt+N` in `BINDINGS`.
- Add a new top-level tab: add a `TabPane` in `compose()` under
  `TabbedContent#main-tabs`, an `action_goto_tab_<x>`, bind `ctrl+N`, and add
  a branch to `on_tabbed_content_tab_activated` and `_context_help_text`.
- Change the LLM: edit `MODEL` in `ask.py`.
- Add a Google action (e.g. create event): add a helper in `gauth.py` and a
  modal/handler in `main.py`.
- Fix a modal crash: check the traceback's `main.py` line; modals subclass
  `ModalScreen` and call `self.dismiss(...)`.
- Cache a new data source: add a category name (see §1a), a `_fetch_*` /
  `_apply_*` pair, write-through in `_live_refresh_thread` (`self._cache.put`
  or `.put_many`), and a read in `_load_from_cache`. If the category is
  "content-sized" (could be large, like Drive file text) rather than a
  small summary, cache it lazily on first successful view, not eagerly for
  a whole listing — see the `drive_file_text` pattern in `_drive_preview`.
- Bump something: update CHANGELOG.md and ROADMAP.md when done.
